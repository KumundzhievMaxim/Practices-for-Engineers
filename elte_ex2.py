# Exercise 2
# Find the length of the longest subsequence of successive rolls, in which the value 6 does not occur.
# (This number can be zero, if only 6s were thrown.)
# For example, in the trial 66423612345654 the longest subsequence of successive rolls in which the value 6 does not occur is 12345. Its length is 5.
