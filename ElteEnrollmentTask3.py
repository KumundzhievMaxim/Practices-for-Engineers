# Exercise 3
# We shall call a sequence of successive rolls in the trial a lucky series, if the sequence contains only 5s and 6s.
# For example 6556665 is a lucky series, with a length of 7.
# Find out, which is the most frequent length for lucky series.
# If there are more than one "most frequent" lucky series lengths, print the longest. If there are no lucky series in the trial, print zero.
