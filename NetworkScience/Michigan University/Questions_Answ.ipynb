    " - The adjacency matrix of an undirected simple graph is symmetric, and therefore has a complete set of real eigenvalues and an orthogonal eigenvector basis. The set of eigenvalues of a graph is the spectrum of the graph.[5] It is common to denote the eigenvalues by ${\\displaystyle \\lambda _{1}\\geq \\lambda _{2}\\geq \\cdots \\geq \\lambda _{n}.}{\\displaystyle \\lambda _{1}\\geq \\lambda _{2}\\geq \\cdots \\geq \\lambda _{n}.}$\n",
    " - The greatest eigenvalue {\\displaystyle \\lambda _{1}}\\lambda _{1} is bounded above by the maximum degree. This can be seen as result of the Perron–Frobenius theorem, but it can be proved easily. Let v be one eigenvector associated to {\\displaystyle \\lambda _{1}}\\lambda _{1} and x the component in which v has maximum absolute value. Without loss of generality assume vx is positive since otherwise you simply take the eigenvector {\\displaystyle -v}-v, also associated to {\\displaystyle \\lambda _{1}}\\lambda _{1}. Then\n",

    "Betweenness centrality measures how important a node is to the shortest paths through the network. To compute betweenness for a node N, we select a pair of nodes and find all the shortest paths between those nodes. Then we compute the fraction of those shortest paths that include node N. If there were five shortest paths between a pair of nodes, and three of them went through node N, then the fraction would be 3÷5=0.6. We repeat this process for every pair of nodes in the network. We then add up the fractions we computed, and this is the betweenness centrality for node N.\n",
