"""Description:
a) Create a random network of 100 nodes and 500 edges! Explain in 2-3 sentences, what are you expecting for the degree distribution of this network!
b) Write an algorithm, which rewires this network by relocating only one end of a single edge in a step.
c) Using the rewiring routine, change the network step by step such, that finally the nodes with largest degree
centrality must have the following degrees: 24, 21, 19, 19, 15, 14. In the first step, when this condition is satisfied, the program must stop.
d) Plot the degree distribution of the final network!"""
